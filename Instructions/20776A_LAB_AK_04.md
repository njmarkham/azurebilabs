3.  This command will return the following error: Operation returned an invalid status code 'Forbidden'.

#### Task 6: Set permissions for the root folder
1.  Switch to the Azure portal.
2.  On the **lakestore*&lt;your name&gt;&lt;date&gt;*** blade, in the breadcrumb trail, click **lakestore*&lt;your name&gt;&lt;date&gt;***, (the root folder of the account) and then click **Access**.
3.  On the **Access** blade, click **+ Add**.

```
4.  This command will return an error.
5.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
DIR E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\Exercise1\\
```
6.  Note that the **Export-AzureRmDataLakeStoreItem** cmdlet has created the **VehicleOwners-downloaded.csv** file (0 bytes), but was unable to read the file's contents. This is because the file existed before permissions were granted to your guest account and, therefore, this account does not have permission to read the contents of the file.

#### Task 9: Set permissions for a file

2.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
Export-AzureRmDataLakeStoreItem -Account $dataLakeStoreName -Path $path -Destination $download -Force
```
This command should now successfully read and download the **VehicleOwners-downloaded.csv** file.
3.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
DIR E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\Exercise1\\
```
4.  Verify that the **VehicleOwners-downloaded.csv** file has been downloaded to **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\Exercise1**.

#### Task 11: Use PowerShell to attempt to upload a new file
1.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
$upload= "/VehicleOwnerData/VehicleOwnersUpdated.csv"
```
2.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
$fileName = "E:\\Labfiles\\Lab04\\Exercise1\\VehicleOwners.csv"
```
3.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
Import-AzureRmDataLakeStoreItem -Account $dataLakeStoreName -Path $fileName -Destination $upload
```
This command will return the following error: Operation returned an invalid status code 'Forbidden'.

#### Task 12: Edit folder permissions to enable file upload

2.  On the **Data Explorer** blade, in the **VehicleOwnerData** folder, click **Access**.
3.  On the **Access** blade, under **Assigned Permissions**, select the **Write** check box for your guest account, and then click **Save**.
4.  Close the Access blade.
5.  Switch to the PowerShell command prompt.
6.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
Import-AzureRmDataLakeStoreItem -Account $dataLakeStoreName -Path $fileName -Destination $upload
```
7.  Switch to the Azure portal.
8.  On the **Data Explorer** blade, verify that **VehicleOwnersUpdated.csv** has now been successfully uploaded.
9.  On the **Data Explorer** blade, click the ellipses (**...**) for **VehicleOwnersUpdated.csv**, and then click **Access**.
10.  Note that your guest user account has been assigned the permissions that you set in the Default Permissions Entry for the VehicleOwnerData folder in Task 3.
11.  Close the Access blade.

#### Task 13: Use PowerShell to overwrite a file
1.  Switch to the PowerShell command prompt.
2.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
Import-AzureRmDataLakeStoreItem -Account $dataLakeStoreName -Path $fileName -Destination $upload -Force
```
3.  This command should successfully overwrite the **VehicleOwnersUpdated.csv** file.
4.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
Get-AzureRmDataLakeStoreChildItem –AccountName $dataLakeStoreName -Path "/VehicleOwnerData"
```
5.  The **LastWriteTime** for **VehicleOwnersUpdated.csv** should have changed to the current system time (minus the few seconds you took to initiate the previous command).

#### Task 14: Use PowerShell to attempt to overwrite a file after a folder permissions change
1.  Switch to the Azure portal.
2.  On the **Data Explorer** blade for the **VehicleOwnerData** folder, click **Access**.
3.  On the **Access** blade, under **Assigned Permissions**, clear the **Write** check box for your guest account, and then click **Save**.
4.  Close the Access blade.
5.  Switch to the PowerShell command prompt.
6.  At the PowerShell command prompt, type the following command, and press Enter:
```
Import-AzureRmDataLakeStoreItem -Account $dataLakeStoreName -Path $fileName -Destination $upload -Force
```
7.  This command will return the following error: Operation returned an invalid status code 'Forbidden'.
    This is because, although your guest user account has Write permission on the file, it does not have Write permission on the folder. Write privileges on a file only enable the file to be appended; they do not enable deletion or overwrite. Without Write access to the folder, the attempted overwrite fails and the old file is left intact.
8.  Close the PowerShell prompt.

>**Result**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a guest user account in Azure AD, and then tested the ability of this account to view folder contents, open files, and upload and update files in Data Lake Store, depending on the specific permissions that are set. You will use the Azure portal to manage the permissions, and use PowerShell as the guest user environment.
