# Module 3: Performing Custom Processing in Azure Stream Analytics

# Lab: Performing custom processing with Stream Analytics

### Scenario
You work for Adatum as a data engineer, and you’ve been asked to build a traffic surveillance system for traffic police. This system must be able to analyze significant amounts of dynamically streamed data—captured from speed cameras and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) devices—and then crosscheck the outputs against large volumes of reference data that holds vehicle, driver, and location information. Fixed roadside cameras, hand-held cameras (held by traffic police), and mobile cameras (in police patrol cars) are used to monitor traffic speeds and raise an alert if a vehicle is travelling too quickly for the local speed limit. The cameras also have built-in ANPR software that reads vehicle registration plates.

For the second phase of the project, you will use Stream Analytics, together with Event Hub, IoT Hubs, Service Bus, Machine Learning, and custom applications to:
-   Post messages to a Service Bus queue for all vehicles that are speeding, by using a simple JavaScript UDF function to determine whether a vehicle’s speed is above a particular limit.
-   Identify vehicles that appear to be using the same registration number, by using a JavaScript UDF function to determine whether a vehicle with the same registration (not necessarily speeding) has been spotted at two locations that are an impossible distance apart within a given timeframe.
-   Identify traffic flow issues, such as road blockages, or excessive speeds, by using Machine Learning with Stream Analytics to detect consistent speed anomalies from a speed camera; for example, if speeds are consistently very low for a period, the cause could be a traffic accident or incident.

### Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
-   Use a Stream Analytics UDF function to identify specific data points.
-   Use a Stream Analytics UDF function to identify duplicate data records.
-   Use Machine Learning with Stream Analytics to identify data anomalies.

## Exercise 1: Use a Stream Analytics UDF function to identify specific data points

### Scenario
For the first part of this next phase of the traffic surveillance system, you will add functionality to identify speeding vehicles. In this exercise, you will add logic to the analytics that capture vehicle speeds, and post a message to a Service Bus queue for all vehicles that are speeding. You will add a simple JavaScript function that ascertains whether a vehicle is speeding. You will then use an updated version of the app from Lab 2 to display the velocity of cars that were caught speeding.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

2. Add a queue to the Service Bus
3. Configure the Location Alerts app
4. Reconfigure the TrafficAnalytics Stream Analytics job
5. Start the Stream Analytics jobs
6. Start the Speed Camera app

```
// UDF that returns an integer value indicating whether a vehicle is speeding
function main(speedLimit, speed) {
return (speed \> speedLimit) ? 1 : 0;
}
```
You copy the preceding code from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab03\\UDF1.txt**.
5.  Add the following to the end of the existing query, to send information about speeding cars to the speed camera message queue:
```
SELECT
CameraID,LocationLatitude,LocationLongitude,SpeedLimit,VehicleRegistration,Speed
INTO
SpeedCameraAlerts
FROM
CameraDataFeed3
WHERE
UDF.IsSpeeding(SpeedLimit, Speed) = 1
```
You copy the preceding commands from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab03\\ASAquery1.txt**.
6.  Set the number of streaming units to **12**, if this is not already set.

#### Task 5: Start the Stream Analytics jobs
1.  Start the **TrafficAnalytics** and **PatrolCarAnalytics** Stream Analytics jobs.
2.  Wait until the jobs have been successfully started before continuing with the lab.

#### Task 6: Start the Speed Camera app
1.  Start a new instance of Visual Studio, and open the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab03\\SpeedCameraDevice\\SpeedCameraDevice** project.
2.  In App.config, in the **appSettings** section, in the **ServiceBusConnectionString** key, replace **YourNamespace** with **camerafeeds*&lt;your name&gt;&lt;date&gt;***, and replace **YourPrimaryKey** with the event hub primary key you copied to **Config\_details.txt**.

#### Task 8: Start the Location Alerts app
1.  Start the **LocationAlerts** project on the local machine.
2.  Verify that the app displays a map (of London), and starts to show the positions of speeding vehicles (and their speed), and the positions of dispatched patrol cars.
>**Note**: The map may take 5-10 minutes to display, and you might also need to wait before all the data appears on the map.

#### Task 9: View the results
1.  Let the system run for a few minutes, to give it time to detect some speeding vehicles, and then observe the fun!
2.  Note that the PatrolCarDevice project reports messages when a patrol car is dispatched to chase a speeding vehicle. You should also see the location of the patrol car change to move to the location reported for the speeding vehicle in the LocationAlerts app.

#### Task 10: Close jobs and apps
1.  Close the PatrolCarAnalytics and TrafficAnalytics jobs.
2.  Reset the **TrafficAnalytics** job to use **1** streaming unit.

You will also have tested this logic using Visual Studio apps.

## Exercise 2: Use a Stream Analytics UDF to identify duplicate data records

### Scenario
For the next part of the traffic surveillance system, you will build logic to identify vehicles that appear to be using the same registration number. In this exercise, you will use a JavaScript function to determine whether a vehicle with the same registration (not necessarily speeding) has been spotted at two locations that are an impossible distance apart within a given timeframe. You will store the details (times, registrations, locations), and this data will be used in a later lab exercise.

#### Task 5: Close jobs and apps
1.  Close the **RegistrationAnalytics** job.
2.  Stop the **SpeedCameraDevice** app.

>**Result**: At the end of this exercise, you will have added new consumer groups to your event hub, and created a new Stream Analytics job that works with a Visual Studio app to generate training data. You will then create a machine learning experiment to detect anomalous data, train your model using the generated training data, and then deploy the trained model as a web service. You will also have created a second new Stream Analytics job that uses the Machine Learning web service, and the model using Visual Studio apps.

**Question**: How might you use Stream Analytics UDF functions to identify specific data points within your organization?

**Question**: What requirements does your organization have for deduplicating information?
